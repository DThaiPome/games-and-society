# Overview - Chlorophyll

This project was made as a final project for my Games & Society class, created with the help of Elena Kosowski and Ava DiPietro. The objective of the project was to create a concept for a game that provided commentary on some social issue. We chose to address the mental health issues students face at schools and universities.

An actual game, rather than a concept, was not required for the final project. However, we chose to create at least a working prototype of the game. We worked over a course of 3-4 weeks. All of the scripts and Unity objects in this reposity were developed by myself.
